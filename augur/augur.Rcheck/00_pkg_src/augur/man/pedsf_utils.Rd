\title{PEDSF reading and recoding dataframes}
\format{Three dataframes, each containing useful recoding or reading-relevant data. 

\describe{
 \item{pedsf_recodes}{1090 rows by 3 columns, this is PEDSF recode data 
                       extracted from an NCI HDRP PDF. 
      \itemize{
              \item{Var}{- The name of the PEDSF variable to be recoded}
              \item{Code}{- The coded representation of variables
                         that are included as part of PEDSF.} 
              \item{Meaning}{- The value that is encoded by `Code` in the 
                         PEDSF variable `Var`.} 
              }
      }
 \item{pedsf_format}{A `data.frame` consisting of 245 rows of PEDSF file 
                     format data, produced using a SEER-Medicare 
                     PEDSF SAS infile. These are useful for reading PEDSF data. 
       \itemize{
              \item{positions}{- In the PEDSF ASCII file, this is the 
                     starting character position for the variable shown in 
                     `vars`.}
              \item{vars}{- The name of a variable that will be read using 
                     a starting position of `positions` and character width
                     of `widths` and variable type `col_types`.}
               }
      }
 \item{pedsf_names}{134 full NAACCR variable names alongside their 
                    corresponding SAS variable names, again from the i
                    SEER-Medicare PEDSF SAS infile.}

\description{
This is a list of three dataframes that are useful for PEDSF data reading and recoding.
  The most important of these three dataframes is `pedsf_format`, whose content 
  was pulled from the SEER-Medicare PDF PEDSF documentation. The 
  `pedsf_recodes` dataframe is, of course, useful in conjunction with the 
  `recode_variable` or `recode_pedsf` functions. Finally, the `pedsf_names`
  dataframe is useful for converting between full versus short variable names.
