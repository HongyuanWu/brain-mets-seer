# `augur`: A seer for SEER

[augur (n.)](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/augur)

1. One of a group of ancient Roman religious officials who foretold events by observing and interpreting signs and omens.   
2. A seer or prophet; a soothsayer.

`augur` is both an observer of signs present in and a tool to drill down into SEER data [(though the drill bit is spelled differently)](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/auger).

This package supports extraction/transformation of SEER-Medicare data into tidy-ish data, with a focus on reproducibility of my dissertation work. As such, some of the artifacts are specific to my work, and may safely be disregarded (namely, the `dissertation_codes`, unless you like that sort of thing).
